/*
Princess Peach has a huge infestation of Goombas, Bob-ombs, and Cheep-cheeps, 
and has commissioned Mario to take care of her pest problem. Mario did the job, 
but he is having trouble keep track of how many he has caught and has asked you 
to build him a website that keeps track of how many baddies he caught for Princess 
Peach so he can send her a bill.

Build the Mario Pest Control website to be responsive, meaning it looks great when 
shrunk down to the screen size of a smartphone.
